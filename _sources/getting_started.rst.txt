In Robotics Club Pulchowk, we have used `OAK-D Pro W`_ Camera as a vision sensor for Automatic Robot of ABU Robocon 2024.
We also used `Pi Camera Module 3 Wide`_ interfaced with Raspberry Pi 4B with Raspian OS (through CSI Camera Port). Moreover,
similar applications are possible with USB cameras like Logitech C270.
