Introduction
===================

These tutorials will be focused on **Robot Perception** stack like Image Processing, Photogrammetry and Computer Vision being focused on applications in the field of robotics. 
A camera interfacing section would be included to deal with specific devices like Depth cameras, Pi-cameras, USB cameras.
Apart from that we will be focusing on problem specific algorithms and their implementations.

The idea of **Robot Perception** revolves around the question of **"What is Where?"**.  
For example: You want to pickup a blue ball. So, at first you need to perceive your surrounding i.e.
**"What does surrounding look like?"**" As per now, we can say surrouding consists of different colored balls.  
Then, we need to know the location of those balls in our real 3D world i.e. **"Where are the balls located?"**"  
The location is 3D coordinate with respect to a reference frame. Finally, we can complete our task to pickup a blue ball.
