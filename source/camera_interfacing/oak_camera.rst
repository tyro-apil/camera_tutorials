OpenCV AI Kit (OAK) Camera
==========================

`OAK-D Pro W`_ has 2 black-and-white mono sensors on each side, 1 RGB sensor at the center, 1 `IR Dot Projector`_ (For **Active Stereo**), and 1 `IR Illumination LED`_ (For **Low light environment**).
For using it with low-power (can't supply more than 1 Amps through USB) Single Board Computer like Raspberry Pi, use the `OAK Y Adapter`_ for powering camera from dedicated power source.
